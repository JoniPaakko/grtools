# grtools
R package for analysis of perceptual independence using general recognition theory.

grtools requires [Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) to work, which in turns requires a development environment with a suitable compiler. If you are getting compiling errors, see the [Rcpp FAQ](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf), particularly points 1.2 and 1.3.

Note that this package is still under development. This is a pre-release version that has not been extensively tested. Also, documentation for many of the functions is missing/incomplete.

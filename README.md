# grtools
**R package for the analysis of perceptual independence using general recognition theory.**

**grtools** provides functions for the following analyses:

1. Model-based analyses of separability and independence with GRT-wIND (Soto et al., 2015) for the 2x2 identification experiment.
2. Model-based analyses of separability and independence with traditional GRT models for the 2x2 identification experiment (Ashby & Soto, 2015).
3. Summary statistics analysis (i.e. Kadlec's MDSDA; see Kadlec & Townsend, 1992) for the 2x2 identification experiment.
4. Summary statistics analysis for the 2x2 Garner filtering task (Ashby & Maddox, 1994).

**grtools** requires [Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) to work, which in turns requires a development environment with a suitable compiler. If you are getting compiling errors, see the [Rcpp FAQ](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf), particularly points 1.2 and 1.3.

After installation. Type the following in the R console:

```R
library(grtools)
?grtools
```

This will open a document that includes links to help documentation for each of the main analyses included in **grtools** (including examples).

**Note that this package is still under development. This is a pre-release version that has not been extensively tested. Also, documentation for many of the functions is missing/incomplete.**
